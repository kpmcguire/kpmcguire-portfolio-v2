Here are some projects I've been working on.

## [Auto Accessible Color Picker][auto]

I made this because I felt like all the other accessible color pickers weren't very good. I like hue-based color pickers (similar to what is used in photohop). I thought it would be cool to give the option to let the app choose the color automatically. This is all possible because of the awesome [Tinycolor][tinycolor] library.
