Here are some projects I've been working on.

## [Auto Accessible Color Picker][auto]

I made this because I felt like all the other accessible color pickers weren't very good. I like hue-based color pickers (similar to what is used in photohop). I thought it would be cool to give the option to let the app choose the color automatically. This is all possible because of the awesome [Tinycolor][tinycolor] library.

## [Ithaca Events Calendar][ithaca]

Another scratching my own itch kind of thing. Although this is still very much a work in progress, the main idea is to collect all the events from the various websites that publish these events and try to show only the highest quality events.
